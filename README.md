# About

This is a small utility to add blur to [ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu) for Windows 10.
Built and tested on Windows 10 Creators update 1703.

#### Why make a program to do this instead of adding it to ConEmu
I made this as a quick way to see if how it would work but found that it was an easy way to add blur. I do plan to work on adding the functionality to ConEmu.

# Requirements
Windows 10

# Usage
Run the program after ConEmu is started.

> ConEmuBlur.exe [opacity]

Opacity is a value from 0 - 100 that represents percentage. The default is 90.
Also disable transparency in conemu options.

# How to build
Build the solution with Visual Studio 2017 C++ tools. Make sure you have the Windows 10 SDK.
